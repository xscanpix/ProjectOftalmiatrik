\section{Schedule}
See attached Gantt diagram. We intend to work the full 40h per week, working from home and planning regular meetings.

There are several milestones we must reach in this project:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A functional GUI for the Android app
	\item A functional system for displaying onto the screen
	\item Networking established between the Android tablet and the RaspberryPi
	\item The finished minimum product
	\item The finished poster for the report
	\item The finished presentation for the report
	\item The finished report
\end{itemize}

\section{Course Goals}
We feel our project matches the course goals by incorporating knowledge from our courses in Operating Systems, Imperative and Object-oriented Programming Methodology, Human-Computer Interaction and Computer Networks. We are also showing advancements in these fields through this project by working with an actual client, designing systems to be used by several people professionally, and working with new tools for a tablet environment.
